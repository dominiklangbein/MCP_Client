I'll help you create an email draft, but I'll need a few more specifics:\n\n1. Sarah Chen's email address\n2. A subject line for the email\n\nI can see you want the body to be \"Hello Gmail!\", which is fine. However, I need an email address to send the draft to. Could you please provide Sarah Chen's full email address?\n\nFor example, it might look like \"sarah.chen@company.com\" or \"sarahchen@gmail.com\". Once you provide the email address, I'll be happy to create the email draft using the Gmail API."
