Without the specific email address, I can't complete the task precisely. \n\nHowever, I can provide some guidance:\n1. If you know Sarah Chen's email address, please provide it to me.\n2. If you're unsure of her exact email, you might want to check your contacts or ask someone in your organization for her correct email address.\n\nOnce you provide me with Sarah Chen's email address, I'll be happy to draft an email praising her for doing a great job. The draft will be a positive and encouraging message highlighting her achievements.\n\nCould you please confirm Sarah Chen's email address so I can proceed with writing the draft?"
