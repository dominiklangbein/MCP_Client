To use the `write_email_draft` function, I would need the specific email address.\n\nCould you please provide Sarah Chen's full email address? Once I have the complete email address, I can help you create the draft email right away using the Gmail API tool.\n\nWould you like to share her email address so I can proceed with creating the draft?"
