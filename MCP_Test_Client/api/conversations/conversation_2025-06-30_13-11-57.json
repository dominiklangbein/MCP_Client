Missing Gmail API credentials\n2. Incorrect user email configuration\n3. API permission issues\n\nTo resolve this, you may want to:\n- Ensure the Gmail API is properly set up\n- Verify that the necessary credentials are in place\n- Check that the USER_EMAIL environment variable is correctly set\n- Confirm you have the required permissions to create email drafts\n\nWould you like me to help you troubleshoot the email draft creation process?"
