If you're looking to interact with Minecraft servers, I would need additional tools or integrations specifically designed for Minecraft server management to assist you effectively.\n\nThe only function I can currently use is `write_email_draft`, which allows me to create email drafts using the Gmail API. Is there something specific related to email that I can help you with?"
